# Hubitat Bluetooth presence detection

This app allows for reporting to Hubitat the proximity of Bluetooth (BT) devices to a specific device (called from here on "the scanner device"), via virtual presence devices in Hubitat.

## Caveats

This is not an exact science. Here's a non-exhaustive list of issues that can impact the reliability:
* Not all BT devices advertise their existence.
* Those that do may not do so continuously (for example, phones may only advertise when in the BT settings).
* Those that do continuously may not be on continuously (for example, may go to sleep to save on battery).
* The strength of the BT signal (RSSI, Received Signal Strength Indicator) is affected by the environment, the device's battery levels, etc.

## Pre-requisites

* A Hubitat hub.
* A linux device on the same LAN as the Hubitat hub that will be performing the scanning.
* The scanner device has a BT adapter. This can be an integrated one or a USB one.
  Note: raspberry 3 and later have an integrated one.
* The `bluetoothctl` and `btmgmt` commands are available on the scanner device. 
  If missing, `apt install bluez` may fix it.

## Setup

### Determining the device(s) mac addresses

These are of the form xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx with each x a digit or a letter between A and F. 

The app needs to know what mac addresse(s) to report and what virtual presence devices in Hubitat they map to.
If your location has a large number of BT devices, figuring out these mappings can be hard. 

The easiest option may asking directly the BT device (e.g., going in the phone's settings for a phone)
or the app that manages it.

If that's not possible, here's the manual & hard way to figure these out:

* From the scanner device, run `sudo bluetoothctl`
* From the interactive prompt, type `scan on`
* Note the MAC addresses of the device(s) of interest
  * Sometimes the device manufacturer is nice and provide the name. Older versions of Tile did just that. Newers don't appear to.
  * While the scan is running some devices will appear and disappear. Unfortunately this doesn't mean they go in/out of range. Not all devices reliably advertise.
* Type `scan off` to stop the scan, followed by `exit`

You should end with a list of pairs (mac address, device name).

## Deciding with or without RSSI

The app can treat the device present or absent based on the presence   

## App

sudo btmgmt find

## Background research

Tried multiple approaches, such as using gattlib, [bluescan](https://pypi.org/project/bluescan/) & [pybluez](https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez) packages. The only method that yielded satisfactory results
was using the btmgmt command line application.
Also tried some code [here](https://github.com/dagar/bluetooth-proximity), [here](https://github.com/ewenchou/bluetooth-proximity) and [here](https://github.com/noelportugal/tilefinder)
